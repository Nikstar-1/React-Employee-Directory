### Project title and Description

Employee Directory

For this assignment, I have created an employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter 

employees by name.

### Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

Sort the table by at least one category

Filter the users by at least one property.
